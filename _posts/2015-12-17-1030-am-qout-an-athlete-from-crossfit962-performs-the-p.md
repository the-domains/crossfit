title: '10:30 AM. Qout, an athlete from @crossfit962, performs the pull-under phase of the medicine ball clean progression. This step in learning the Olympic lifts is critical, and for beginners the medicine ball is a great tool for introducing the concept. The medicine ball clean also makes for some devastating workouts. From here the L-1 participants will parter and be asked to coach one another through a workout. L-1 Staff circle the floor, giving feedback not to the participant performing the workout, but the one coaching. For new trainers, this can be a challenging trial by fire, but everyone will leave here knowing what he or she needs to work on. #CrossFit #crossfitseminarstaff #crossfitinjordan @crossfittraining'
