# Fitness in 100 Words

> "Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will
> support exercise but not body fat. Practice and train major lifts: deadlift, clean, squat, presses, clean and
> jerk, and snatch. Similarly, master the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climbs, push-ups, sit-ups,
> presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips, splits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc, hard and fast. Five or six
> days per week mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the
> enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly learn and play new sports."
