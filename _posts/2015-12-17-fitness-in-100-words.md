# Fitness in 100 Words

Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will
support exercise but not body fat. Practice and train major lifts: deadlift, clean, squat, presses, clean and
jerk, and snatch. Similarly, master the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climbs, push-ups, sit-ups,
presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips, splits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc, hard and fast. Five or six
days per week mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the
enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly learn and play new sports.
