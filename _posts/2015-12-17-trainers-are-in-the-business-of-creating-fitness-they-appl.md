title: '"Trainers are in the business of creating fitness. They apply exercises to their clients in order to induce adaptations in structure and function that lead to improved fitness. In order to do this effectively, reliably and safely, working trainers must understand the structures they are stressing with exercise to produce the functional change that is fitness. This is the primary reason we learn anatomy and physiology. We need to understand the materials we work with in our occupation in order to accomplish the job we are expected to deliver." - "Lon Kilgore, PHD -ANATOMY & PHYSIOLOGY A PRIMER FOR CROSSFIT TRAINERS Find this and more in the CrossFit Journal. @crossfit #CrossFit #CrossFitTraining'
