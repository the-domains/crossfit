title: "SUNDAY 151122 Complete as many rounds as possible in 10 minutes of: 20 box jumps, 24-inch box/20-inch box* 10 handstand push-ups Post rounds completed to comments. Beginner Complete as many rounds as possible in 8 minutes of: 20 box jumps, 20-inch box/16-inch box* 10 feet-elevated push-ups Post rounds completed to comments. The time is decreased to prevent excess volume of box jumps for the beginner. The elevated push-up is a plank position push-up with the feet elevated. Start with the feet on a 45lb plate and if able, increase height of feet. The athlete must maintain a rigid body position through the entire range of motion. If this is too difficult choose a standard push-up or go to the knees. Intermediate Complete as many rounds as possible in 10 minutes of: 20 box jumps, 24-inch box/20-inch box* 5 handstand push-ups 5 push-ups Post rounds completed to comments. For the intermediate who has some handstand push-ups the repetitions per round are decreased to encourage building stamina in the movement without decreasing the intensity of the workout. If 5 handstand push-ups are too many per round decrease further. Consider 2 handstand push-ups and 8 elevated push-ups. Log the total repetitions of handstand push-ups to use in scaling future workouts. If the handstand push-up is not yet possible, use the scale above. *Suggested women's heights are a guideline not a limit. @crossfit #CrossFit #CFWodScale"
