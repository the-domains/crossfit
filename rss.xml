The hotel hassled our squad about parking bikes on the hotel premises. It's hard to believe a place that valets BMWs and Maseratis couldn't handle six bikes. After a talk in the lobby we headed into the conference room. #squadgoals]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[10:30 AM. Qout, an athlete from @crossfit962, performs the pull-under phase of the medicine ball clean progression. This step in learning the Olympic lifts is critical, and for beginners the medicine ball is a great tool for introducing the concept. The medicine ball clean also makes for some devastating workouts. From here the L-1 participants will parter and be asked to coach one another through a workout. L-1 Staff circle the floor, giving feedback not to the participant performing the workout, but the one coaching. For new trainers, this can be a challenging trial by fire, but everyone will leave here knowing what he or she needs to work on. #CrossFit #crossfitseminarstaff #crossfitinjordan @crossfittraining]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[At the luncheon today, I walked by the table labeled "CrossFit" while plates of chocolate dessert were being dropped off. A lady in charge told the waiter that it was "clearly the Paleo table." She then told the waiter to switch the dessert to mixed fruit. I couldn't help but laugh. Everyone in the room is wearing a collar except for our squad. The majority of the crowd was older and when Greg said to stop or reverse cardiovascular disease you have to "not smoke, exercise and change your diet," you could tell most people in the room were listening intently. @crossfitdowney @catoinstitute #californiainvasion]]></title>
