            <title><![CDATA[If you've been to any of the #californiainvasion stops you've probably put a sticker on someone's back. It's sort of turned into a game and people are getting more and more creative with the placing of stickers on their friends. The sticker on the back is the most common, but this is one of the best I've seen. #CrushBigSoda @nicolejustinepeyton]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[SUNDAY 151122 Complete as many rounds as possible in 10 minutes of: 20 box jumps, 24-inch box/20-inch box* 10 handstand push-ups Post rounds completed to comments. Beginner Complete as many rounds as possible in 8 minutes of: 20 box jumps, 20-inch box/16-inch box* 10 feet-elevated push-ups Post rounds completed to comments. The time is decreased to prevent excess volume of box jumps for the beginner. The elevated push-up is a plank position push-up with the feet elevated. Start with the feet on a 45lb plate and if able, increase height of feet. The athlete must maintain a rigid body position through the entire range of motion. If this is too difficult choose a standard push-up or go to the knees. Intermediate Complete as many rounds as possible in 10 minutes of: 20 box jumps, 24-inch box/20-inch box* 5 handstand push-ups 5 push-ups Post rounds completed to comments. For the intermediate who has some handstand push-ups the repetitions per round are decreased to encourage building stamina in the movement without decreasing the intensity of the workout. If 5 handstand push-ups are too many per round decrease further. Consider 2 handstand push-ups and 8 elevated push-ups. Log the total repetitions of handstand push-ups to use in scaling future workouts. If the handstand push-up is not yet possible, use the scale above. *Suggested women's heights are a guideline not a limit. @crossfit #CrossFit #CFWodScale]]></title>

The hotel hassled our squad about parking bikes on the hotel premises. It's hard to believe a place that valets BMWs and Maseratis couldn't handle six bikes. After a talk in the lobby we headed into the conference room. #squadgoals]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[10:30 AM. Qout, an athlete from @crossfit962, performs the pull-under phase of the medicine ball clean progression. This step in learning the Olympic lifts is critical, and for beginners the medicine ball is a great tool for introducing the concept. The medicine ball clean also makes for some devastating workouts. From here the L-1 participants will parter and be asked to coach one another through a workout. L-1 Staff circle the floor, giving feedback not to the participant performing the workout, but the one coaching. For new trainers, this can be a challenging trial by fire, but everyone will leave here knowing what he or she needs to work on. #CrossFit #crossfitseminarstaff #crossfitinjordan @crossfittraining]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[At the luncheon today, I walked by the table labeled "CrossFit" while plates of chocolate dessert were being dropped off. A lady in charge told the waiter that it was "clearly the Paleo table." She then told the waiter to switch the dessert to mixed fruit. I couldn't help but laugh. Everyone in the room is wearing a collar except for our squad. The majority of the crowd was older and when Greg said to stop or reverse cardiovascular disease you have to "not smoke, exercise and change your diet," you could tell most people in the room were listening intently. @crossfitdowney @catoinstitute #californiainvasion]]></title>
